# MyoReach
By Ian Kim

### Introduction
  5000 years. That's roughly how long we've been working with mechanics, which is miniscule compared to the hundreds of millions of years nature has had in perfecting biomechanics.  MyoReach is a biomimetic robotic hand that utilizes a small understanding of our own biomechanics, muscles and tendons. My inspiration and interest for prosthetics all started with a fictional character. Spider-Man, a hero fondly recognized by most of the world, is the embodiment of community, innovation and valor. Whilst playing the Spider-man PS4 game, where Peter Parker (Spider-Man) blends technology and empathy to create a positive impact. I was inspired by this idea of helping people who have lost a part of themselves serving, from disease, genetics and unfortunate accidents through prosthetic. 

  I started working on my first prototype, a folding retractable mechanical arm with three fingers/claws. In the first iteration, the fingers/claws were directly attached to the servos for predictable and unhindered movement. Though it was able to grab objects with stability, I felt it lacked the human dexterity required for more delicate tasks. I also considered how the design's appearance might affect its approachability. What is the buyers main concern when purchasing this type of product? When it comes to restoring functionality that people have lost, most don't dwell on effective, they want familiar. The second iteration would begin with hopes of designing a biomimetic hand, that could function similarly to my own and successfully handle a range of everyday objects. Keeping my inspiration at heart, a vital goal of this project was keeping it affordable yet capable.
